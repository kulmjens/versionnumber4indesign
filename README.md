Script to increment text variable on save

A simple script tested with InDesign CS6 that will increment the value of the text variable "Versionnumber" on the event of saving the document. If there is no text variable with that name, nothing will happen. :-)

To insert a text variable make a text box, place the cursor where you want it and go to Type -> Text Variables -> Define, click "New" and set name to "Versionnumber", set type to "custom text", fill in a "1" in the textfield and click "OK". Then choose "Insert" to insert the text variable at the cursor position and click "Done" to close the window. 

I run this script on startup so that I can place the text variable in my document at any time.
