Script to increment text variable on save

A simple script tested with InDesign CS6 that will increment the value of the text variable "Versionnumber" on the event of saving the document. If there is no text variable with that name, nothing will happen. :-)

I run this script on startup so that I can place the text variable in my document at any time.
